  <br><span>(ABOUT ME)</span> </br>
  I'm a product designer with a passion for creating products that not only look
  good but also solve real problems. When I'm not sketching ideas on paper, you
  can find me binge-watching a Netflix series or playing video games. My design
  philosophy is simple: make it visually appealing, functional, and bring a
  smile to people's faces. I'm the designer you want on your team if you want to
  make people say 'I need that in my life!'.
